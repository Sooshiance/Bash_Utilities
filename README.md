## Debian bases

- logger.sh : collect all log files from **`kernel`**, **`postgres`**, **`system messages`** and **firewall`**

- update.sh : First we will check if there is back up tool to take back up from existing packages and than update the system, after **`update`** command,
  we will let users decide to **`upgrade`** their systems or not

- battery.sh : We will check **`battery`** health.

- system_health : We will gather the **`cpu_usage`**, **`memory_usage`** and **`disk_usage`** and than display them to the user.

- backup.sh : We will make back up from the whole **`Postgresql`** database.
  `caution`: You need to provide your **`database`** connection info to let **`backup.sh`** make backup.

- netstate.sh : We will check net state with **`tcpdump`** command.
